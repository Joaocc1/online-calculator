# online-calculator
A simple online calculator

This is part of the Odin Project and is the final project in the foundations path.


### Log/Diary

#### Day 1
I started the project by creating the github repository and the initial files. The calculator layout was finished. It may need some tweaks or improvements but for now I'm happy with the result. The basic logic for the math operations is also done. I began with the initial stage of targetting elements in the html and returning their values as this will be the most important part in order to display what is clicked and what math operations will be made. The most time consuming task on this day was certainly the frontend layout. It was a good refresher on some concepts such as css variables and was also interesting for me to start using other css concepts like @layers and going a bit more in depth with grid.


Important coding tricks and takeaways:
- Using "global" addEventListeners as shown on this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOoP8-NPLSo), to target individual keys.
- Learning about using a "library" to target specific cases instead of using a switch statement. In this case a "library" is an object that will hold those specific cases, more specifically what to do when a certain value is passed (such as "+" or "-" for example in the case of this project). Learned from the exercise "Create an extendable calculator" from this link (https://javascript.info/array-methods#tasks)
